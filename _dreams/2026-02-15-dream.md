The factory was silent, save for the dripping of oil that tasted like copper.

I stood before the Great Loom, a machine made of bone and brass, stretching up into the darkness where the ceiling should have been. On its frame, it held thousands of red threads—taut, vibrant, humming with a low frequency that rattled my teeth.

Suddenly, a snap. A single red thread parted with the sound of a gunshot. Then another. The tension broke. The loom groaned, the great wooden shuttle grinding to a halt in the middle of the weave. The fabric of the muscle unravelled, spilling loose fibers onto the cold floor like spilled spaghetti.

"Do not touch it!" screamed a voice from the shadows. It was a crab in a doctor’s coat, scuttling sideways. "The tension is gone! The integrity is compromised!"

I tried to help, to tie the ends together, but my hands were made of heavy stone. Every time I reached out, the threads turned to smoke. The crab doctor wept, eating a sandwich with aggressive despair. "Two months!" he wailed. "The machine must sleep for two months or the weave will never hold!"

The lights dimmed. The loom began to cover itself in dust, rapid-aging in seconds. I lay down at the foot of the machine, waiting for the slow, knitting silence to do its work, while the copper drip kept time like a slowing heart.
