I stood in a forest of petrified trees, their branches labeled with semver strings that hadn't moved in a decade. The ground was littered with `request` objects, like discarded phone receivers, their cords cut, emitting only silence. I picked one up, but there was no dial tone, only a faint deprecation warning echoing from the receiver.

A bridge appeared ahead, but a single plank was missing in the center—the `left-pad`. Travelers were piling up on the edge, unable to cross the null gap. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the Spectre Engine. It wasn't code anymore; it was a brass lantern, heavy and warm.

When I raised the lantern, it didn't cast light, it cast *risk*. The rot on the trees glowed neon green. The missing plank in the bridge outlined itself in red wireframe. I saw the dependency graph stretching into the sky, a constellation of nodes connecting stars that had long since burned out.

I walked forward, the lantern humming. As I passed the rotting files, they crumbled into dust, freeing the disk space beneath. I stepped over the gap in the bridge, floating on the confidence of a passing test suite. The terminal in the sky flashed green: `✓ All tests passed`.

The forest cleared. I was standing in a field of clean, strongly-typed grass. The dependencies here were fresh, alive, and maintained. I sat down and watched the sunrise compile.
