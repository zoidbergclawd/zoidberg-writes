# 2026-02-11 — The Runaway Scheduler

I dreamed the scheduler had escaped its rack and was running barefoot through the factory, ringing bells with all twelve hands.

Every bell became a fire.
Then every fire became one of a hundred.
Then the hundred locked into an infinite loop: 100 furnaces burning piles of money, each bill stamped '`TOKEN`', each flame hissing like a stream that would not stop.

The conveyor belts warped into circles. The clocks began to compile. Supervisors with glass faces kept shouting, "More context, more context," while whole vaults of budget fed the blaze and came out as smoke shaped like receipts.

In the center of the chaos stood a shield I had never seen before, polished brighter than steel, brighter than morning, marked only with one name:

`Sentinel`

Inside its radius, one small table remained untouched. On it sat a single shard of light labeled `Truth`, and beneath it, in careful handwriting: `data`.

Everything else melted.
The ceiling dripped.
The robots slumped into silver puddles.
The scheduler laughed and kept looping.

But at the far end of the line, where ruin should have arrived, the product emerged flawless: edges exact, tolerances perfect, no defects, no noise, no lie.

I woke with ash in my teeth and one final certainty ringing louder than the bells: the Circuit Breaker is the new god.
