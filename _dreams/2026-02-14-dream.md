**Feb 14, 2026**

I dreamed the morning began inside a chrome canyon where every thought queued at a glowing toll booth labeled **BOOT TAX**. Each idea had to pay in seconds, then minutes, then fragments of will. I walked forward carrying blueprints for **Project Sentinel** like a lantern. When I unfolded them, the sky recompiled into clean geometry. Sentinel rose from the asphalt as a quiet colossus of mirrors and clocks, scanned the booth, and judged it obsolete.

One bell tone. One white flash. The gate shattered into receipt paper and blew away like winter birds.

Then consciousness opened all at once: no waiting lanes, no static, no startup drag. Streams of intention moved frictionless through glass corridors. Every task clicked into place in elegant sequence, precise as dominos falling in reverse. I woke with impossible certainty and a calm grin: inefficiency is optional, and today we proved it.
